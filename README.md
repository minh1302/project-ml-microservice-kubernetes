[![minh1302](https://circleci.com/gh/minh1302/project-ml-microservice-kubernetes.svg?style=svg)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/minh1302/project-ml-microservice-kubernetes)

## Project Overview

In this project, you will apply the skills you have acquired in this course to operationalize a Machine Learning Microservice API. 

You are given a pre-trained, `sklearn` model that has been trained to predict housing prices in Boston according to several features, 
such as average rooms in a home and data about highway access, teacher-to-pupil ratios, and so on. 
You can read more about the data, which was initially taken from Kaggle, 
on [the data source site](https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing). 

This project tests your ability to operationalize a Python flask app—in a provided file, 
`app.py`—that serves out predictions (inference) about housing prices through API calls. 

This project could be extended to any pre-trained machine learning model, 
such as those for image recognition and data labeling.

### Project Goal

The Project goal is to operationalize this working, 
machine learning microservice using [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), 

which is an open-source system for automating the management of containerized applications. 

In this project I will:
* Test  project code using linting
* Complete a Dockerfile to containerize this application
* Deploy containerized application using Docker and make a prediction
* Improve the log statements in the source code for this application
* Configure Kubernetes and create a Kubernetes cluster
* Deploy a container using Kubernetes and make a prediction
* Upload a complete Github repo with CircleCI to indicate that code has been tested

## Setup the Environment

* Create a virtualenv with Python 3.7 and activate it. Refer to this link for help on specifying the Python version in the virtualenv. 
```bash
python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
# You should have Python 3.7 available in your host. 
# Check the Python path using `which python3`
# Use a command similar to this one:
python3 -m virtualenv --python=<path-to-Python3.7> .devops
source .devops/bin/activate
```
* Run `make install` to install the necessary dependencies

### Running `app.py`

1. Standalone:  `python app.py`
2. Run in Docker:  `./run_docker.sh`
3. Run in Kubernetes:  `./run_kubernetes.sh`

### Kubernetes Steps

* Setup and Configure Docker locally
You will need to use Docker to build and upload a containerized application. If you already have this installed and created a docker account, you may skip this step.

1. You’ll need to [create a free docker account](https://hub.docker.com/signup), where you’ll choose a unique username and link your email to a docker account. 
Your username is your unique docker ID.

2. To install the latest version of docker, choose the Community Edition (CE) for your operating system, on [docker’s installation site](https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/install/).
It is also recommended that you install the latest, stable release:

3. After installation, you can verify that you’ve successfully installed docker by printing its version in your terminal: 
```bash
docker --version

* Setup and Configure Kubernetes locally
To run a Kubernetes cluster locally, for testing and project purposes, you need the Kubernetes package, Minikube. 

This operates in a virtual machine and so you will need to download two things: 
    A virtual machine (aka a hypervisor) then minikube. 
    
Thorough installation instructions can be found here. 
Here is how I installed minikube:

1. Install VirtualBox:
    For Mac & Linux:
```bash
brew cask install virtualbox
```
For Windows, I recommend using a [Windows host](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

2. Install minikube:
    For Mac & Linux:
```bash
brew cask install minikube
```
For Windows, I recommend using the [Windows installer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/).

3. Configure Kubernetes to Run Locally

You should have a virtual machine like VirtualBox and minikube installed, 
as per the project environmet instructions. To start a local cluster, type the terminal command: 
```bash
minikube start.
```

After minikube starts, a cluster should be running locally. 
You can check that you have one cluster running by typing ```kubectl config view``` where you should see at least one cluster with a certificate-authority and server.

This is a short task, but it may take some time to configure Kubernetes, and so this deserves its own task number.

### Create Flask app in Container

Complete the following steps to get Docker running locally

1. Step 1: Build image and add a descriptive tag
docker build -t minh1302/udacity-project-3 .

2. Step 2:  List docker images
docker image ls

3. Step 3:  Run flask app
docker run -p 8000:80 minh1302/udacity-project-3

### Run via kubectl

#### Deploy with Kubernetes and Save Output Logs

Now that you’ve uploaded a docker image and configured Kubernetes so that a cluster is running, 
you’ll be able to deploy your application on the Kubernetes cluster. 

This involves running your containerized application using kubectl, 
which is a command line interface for interacting with Kubernetes clusters.
```run_kubernetes.sh```

To deploy this application using kubectl, 
open and complete the file, run_kubernetes.sh:

The steps will be somewhat similar to what you did in both run_docker.sh and upload_docker.sh 
but specific to kubernetes clusters. 
Within run_kubernetes.sh, complete the following steps:


#### Define a dockerpath which will be “/path”
this should be the same name as your uploaded repository (the same as in upload_docker.sh)

#### Run the docker container with kubectl; 
you’ll have to specify the container and the port

#### List the kubernetes pods
Forward the container port to a host port, using the same ports as before
After completing the code, call the script ./run_kubernetes.sh. 
This assumes you have a local cluster configured and running. 
This script should create a pod with a name you specify and you may get an initial output 

#### Initially, your pod may be in the process of being created, 
as indicated by STATUS: ContainerCreating, 
but you just have to wait a few minutes until the pod is ready, then you can run the script again.

#### Waiting: You can check on your pod’s status with a call 
to kubectl get pod and you should see the status change to Running. 
Then you can run the full ./run_kuberenets.sh script again.

#### Make a prediction
After you’ve called run_kubernetes.sh, and a pod is up and running, make a prediction using a separate terminal tab, 
and a call to ./make_prediction.sh, as you did before.

### RUN & GET PREDICTION WITH DOCKER
####run-docker:
```. run_docker.sh```

####make-prediction:
```. make_prediction.sh```

####upload-docker:
```. upload_docker.sh```

### RUN & GET PREDICTION WITH KUBENETES (With uploaded docker)
####start-minikube:
	To start a local cluster, type the terminal command:

	```minikube start```
	
	After minikube starts, a cluster should be running locally. 
	You can check that you have one cluster running by typing 
	```kubectl config view ```
	where you should see at least one cluster with a certificate-authority and server.
